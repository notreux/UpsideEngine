# [Extended from BaseObject](BaseObject.md) Particle 
!!! warning 
  Currently it's recommended to use sprites to make particles/vfx, this class is in experimental state and can change a lot

  _____
  This class is used for vfx

	 
# Properties

Depending on the value the particles will be more dispersed
  
## [TweenInfo](TweenInfo.md) Info
Is the tween info of the tween which is going to be used to move the particles
  
## [boolean](boolean.md) TrackLight
!!! warning 
  	Experimental, dont use
  
## [boolean](boolean.md) CanCollide
!!! warning 
  	Experimental, dont use
  
## [boolean](boolean.md) Enabled
When its enabled new particles can be emitted
  
## [number](number.md) MaxRate
Is the maximum amount of particles that can exist at the same time
  
## [number](number.md) Units
Is the amount of particles that are existing at this moment
  
## [number](number.md) LightBrightness
!!! warning 
  	Experimental, dont use
  
## [number](number.md) LightRange
!!! warning 
  	Experimental, dont use

## [number](number.md) Range
Is the distance that can be traveled by each particle 
  
## [number](number.md) LifeTime
The number of seconds the particle will be active before being destroyed

## [table](table.md) Properties 
Is a table with the initial properties of the particle which is going to be generated
   
```lua
{
 	Image: string,
}
```
## [table](table.md) Goals
