# [Extended from PhysicalObject](PhysicalObject.md) Fluid 
This class is used to simulate fluids
	 
# Properties

## [number](number.md) Density
Indicates how much dense the fluid should be. Higher values indicate a denser fluid, 
        affecting buoyancy and movement of objects within the fluid
  
## [number](number.md) Viscosity
Determines the flow resistance of the fluid. Higher values indicate a thicker fluid, 
        affecting the speed at which objects can move through it
  
## [number](number.md) WavesAmplitude
Specifies the magnitude of the fluid waves. These waves are not visible but influence buoyancy and object stability.
  
## [number](number.md) WavesSpeed
Determines how fast the waves should move
