## Introduction to Tile Editor
Click on the Tile Editor button, and a new window named "Tile Editor" will appear. In this interface, you can easily build a scenario.

Within the Tile Editor, you'll find some fields:

- Image Id: Enter the URL of your tile image here.
- Size: Specify the dimensions to determine the size of your tile.
- ZIndex: Assign a numerical value to control whether the tile should appear in front of or behind other tiles.
- CanCollide: Toggle this option to enable or disable collisions for the tile. This feature can prove beneficial, particularly when creating terrains.
