In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of creating a basic game scenario using Upside Engine, a framework for Roblox 2d game development.

!!! Tip
    In this guide we are going to use Offset, scale should never be used for a 2D game, as it is problematic on some devices, it is recommended that when building your game you use 1920x1080 resolution in the device emulator as it will adapt to most devices.



## Step 1: Setting up the scene
The first thing we need to do is to create a scenario for our game. To do this, we'll use the `Scene` object, which is a useful tool for creating scenarios quickly and easily.

???+ warning
	If you are using roblox studio, the scripts with "init" as name works different, means that all the scripts in the same directory are gonna be children of that script, so to explain it easier, just create a local script named "Client" in StarterPlayerScripts and place any `module script` as a children of it.

	example:

In your `init.client.luau` script, add the following code:

```lua
local replicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local tweenService = game:GetService("TweenService")
local players = game:GetService("Players")

local packages = replicatedStorage.packages
local playerGui = players.LocalPlayer:WaitForChild("PlayerGui")

local upsideEngine = require(packages.UpsideEngine)
local screen = Instance.new("ScreenGui")
screen.Name = "MyGame"
screen.IgnoreGuiInset = true
screen.Parent = playerGui

local scene = upsideEngine.new("Scene")
scene.Instance.Parent = screen
scene:SetName("MyFirstScene") -- We set the scene name
scene:Enable() -- We mark as enabled the scene
```
This code creates a new Scene object and adds it to the PlayerGui object in your game.

## Step 2: Creating the floor
Now that we have our scene set up, we can create a floor for our game. To do this, we'll use the PhysicalObject object.

```lua
local leftFloor = upsideEngine.new("PhysicalObject")
leftFloor.Anchored = true
leftFloor:SetScene(scene)

local lfInstance = leftFloor.Instance
lfInstance.Image = "rbxassetid://12980969571" -- We set the floor texture
lfInstance.Size = UDim2.fromOffset(600, 160) -- We set the size to 600x160 pixels
lfInstance.Position = UDim2.fromOffset(300, 1000) -- We set the position to 300x1000 pixels

local rightFloor = upsideEngine.new("PhysicalObject") -- We create the floor and pass the scene as the parent object
rightFloor.Anchored = true
rightFloor:SetScene(scene)

local rfInstance = rightFloor.Instance
rfInstance.Image = "rbxassetid://12980969571" -- We set the floor texture
rfInstance.Size = UDim2.fromOffset(600, 160) -- We set the size to 600x160 pixels
rfInstance.Position = UDim2.fromOffset(1620, 1000) -- We set the position to 1620x1000 pixels
```
This code creates a new PhysicalObject object and adds it to our scene. We then set the floor's texture and size.

## Step 3: Creating a background
Next, let's add a background to our game. This time we'll use another PhysicalObject object, but we'll set it up a little differently.

```lua
local background = Instance.new("Frame")
background.BackgroundTransparency = 0 -- We set the background transparency
background.BackgroundColor3 = Color3.fromRGB(27, 62, 82)
background.Size = UDim2.fromScale(1, 1) -- We set the size to the target screen size
background.Position = UDim2.fromOffset(0.5, 0.5) -- We set the position to the center
background.ZIndex = -1
background.Parent = scene.Instance.Parent
```
This code creates a new PhysicalObject object and adds it to our scene. We then set the background's texture and size to the full screen size.

## Step 4: Adding decoration
Next, let's add a the decoration to our game. This time we'll use another PhysicalObject object, but we'll set it up a little differently.

```lua
local decoration = upsideEngine.new("PhysicalObject") -- We create the decoration and pass the scene as the parent object
decoration.TrackCollisions = false
decoration:SetScene(scene)

local decInstance = decoration.Instance
decInstance.Image = "rbxassetid://12993235175" -- We set the decoration texture
decInstance.Size = UDim2.fromOffset(1920, 1080) -- We set the size to the target screen size
decInstance.Position = UDim2.fromOffset(960, 540) -- We set the position to the center
decInstance.ZIndex = 0
```
This code creates a new PhysicalObject object and adds it to our scene. We then set the background's texture and size to the full screen size.


## Step 5: Creating platforms
Finally, let's create some interactive platforms for our game, we will create a platform that falls once it detects a collision.

```lua
-- Create platform object and set properties
local function createPlatform(x, y)
	local position = UDim2.fromOffset(x, y)
	local platform = upsideEngine.new("PhysicalObject")
	platform:SetScene(scene)
	platform.Mass = 0
	platform.Anchored = false

	local platInstance = platform.Instance
	platInstance.Image = "rbxassetid://12979703349"
	platInstance.Size = UDim2.fromOffset(250, 80)
	platInstance.Position = position
	platInstance.ZIndex = 2

	-- Create Tween to animate platform to its original position on collision
	local info = TweenInfo.new(1)
	local goal = { Position = position }

	local toOrigin = tweenService:Create(platform.Instance, info, goal)
	local falling = false
	toOrigin.Completed:Connect(function()
		falling = false
	end)

	-- Listen to the "Collision" event
	platform:On("Collision", function(object) -- Create a function to detect when the plaform collides
		if not object:IsA("Character") or falling then
			return
		end

		task.wait(1)
		falling = true
		platform.Mass = 200

		task.wait(5)
		platform.Mass = 0
		platform.Force = Vector2.zero

		toOrigin:Play()
	end)
end

createPlatform(800, 900)
createPlatform(1120, 900)

for _, scr in script:GetChildren() do
	require(scr) --Initializate the secondary scripts
end
```
